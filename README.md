##### About

Arrival Survival is a single-player game about helping survive an alien that accidentally ended up on Earth going through some of the events of 2020 like the Australian wildfires 🔥, Corona virus 🦠, toilet paper scarcity 🧻, demonstrations and riots 💪, and finally lockdown 🏠.


My biggest challenge was to achieve an MVP given that each 2020-event is a level with a different speed, its own "coins" to collect to get points, and obstacles to avoid because they hurt the player. That’s why I decided to sacrifice adding start buttons and other UI features which functionalities I just solved by manipulating the DOM.


There are still things I would like to add or modify but it’s a fully functional game with sounds, different levels, a start and an end (if you manage to bring the alien to safety)


I chose to build this game because I was inspired by [this game](https://2020game.io) with the same topic. Of course my game can't compare because I developed it on my own in only 4 days, but I need to give credit a many thanks to who inspired me.
